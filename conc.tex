\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Java is a highly used programming language in industry, and Java 8 is one of
the most significant upgrades to the language. Eclipse is a popular IDE for
Java. The purpose of our project is to allow Eclipse developers to
automatically refactor their legacy Java software to use new Java 8 features.
We are currently in the process of porting an enhanced \lstinline{for} loop
refactoring from NetBeans to Eclipse. In future, we plan to develop
refactorings for Java 8 that do not currently exist in any IDE\@.
