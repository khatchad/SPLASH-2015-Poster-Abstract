\section{Current State of Progress}

As we are making progress toward the implementation, one of the technical
challenges we face is the difference between the Eclipse and NetBeans
refactoring and source code representation models. The IDEs use different
libraries for these purposes, e.g., NetBeans uses primarily javac libraries,
while Eclipse uses the Java Development Tools (JDT).  For instance, NetBeans
has API for retrieving uncaught exceptions in an AST subtree, while the JDT
does not expose such external API\@. To check the corresponding precondition,
we implemented this functionality ourselves.  The plug-in is open source and
publicly available at \url{http://git.io/lambdarefact}.
