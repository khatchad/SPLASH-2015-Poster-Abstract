\section{Current State of Progress}

Currently, we are in the process of finalizing the plug-in that will port the
NetBeans refactoring implementation to Eclipse. We are identifying and
implementing precondition checking code. The plug-in is open source and
publicly
available\footnote{\url{http://github.com/mdarefin/Convert-For-Each-Loop-to-Lambda-Expression-Eclipse-Plugin}}.
